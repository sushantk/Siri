Principles
   * Simple for user
   * Reduce boiler plate code
   * Performance
   
Streaming

Open connection

Client side framework

Callback
   * callbacks should return object tree
   * callback joiner

TaskManager
   * Interleaves sync and async tasks
   * If all sync tasks are over, then waits for an async task to get ready
   * Makes sure tasks execute in a single thread

SourceWebService
   * deduping
   * populate metadata in DO

SourceCache
   * "use" for subsource
      * How can controller override subsource's url?
   * collapse when refreshing
   
Logging

Event

ObjectTree
   * "use" - two phase configure
  
Caching
   * Memory caching for repo related
   * JCS for data

Testing
   * Component testing with mocked inputs.
   * Logs are critical, think of users trying to debug rather than you.
